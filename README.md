# 2025 World Tariff Data

# Overview

On April, 2nd, 2025 the United States signed executive order 14257 which imposed tariffs around the world. The data retrived from Wikipedia provided tariff percentages to individual countries. Using Python, Javascrpit, and many other platforms we created a simple data vizualization track to help analyze what is going on. 
Frist we uploaded to the Data a SQL database. With the data stored in SQL the data was exported in a JSON to analyze in Python and visualize in Javascript.

# How to Use
